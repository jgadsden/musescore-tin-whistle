# musescore-tin-whistle
An extra instrument file for adding more tin whistle types to Musescore, it needs to be
installed as an instrument extension using the MuseScore menu. IUse the same file for
both MuseScore-2 and MuseScore-3:

MuseScore-2
1. copy file this tin-whistle.xml file to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: File -> Preferences... -> Scores tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml and add to 'Instrument List 2'
5. MuseScore wil now list more tin whistles under 'World Music' 'Woodwinds'

MuseScore-3
1. copy file this tin-whistle.xml file to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: MuseScore -> Preferences... -> Score tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml and add to 'Instrument List 2'
5. MuseScore wil now list more tin whistles under 'World Music' 'Woodwinds'

Once the tin whistle staff is added to the score, then there is no need to keep this instrument
file in the 'Instrument List 2' extension.
