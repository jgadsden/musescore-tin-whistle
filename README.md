# musescore-tin-whistle
An extra instrument file for adding moe tin whistle types to Musescore, it needs to be added
as an instrument extension using the MuseScore menu. It uses the same file for both MuseScore-2
and MuseScore-3:

MuseScore-2
1. copy file tin-whistle.xml to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/instruments.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: File -> Preferences... -> Scores tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/instruments.xml and apply to 'Instrument List 2'
5. MuseScore wil now list the Bodhrán under 'World Music' 'Percussion - Unpitched'

MuseScore-3
1. copy file tin-whistle.xml to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/instruments.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: MuseScore -> Preferences... -> Score tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/instruments.xml and apply to 'Instrument List 2'
5. MuseScore wil now list the Bodhrán under 'World Music' 'Percussion - Unpitched'

Once the tin whistle staff is added to the score, then there is no need to keep this instrument
file in the 'Instrument List 2' extension.
