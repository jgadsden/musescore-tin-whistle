# musescore-tin-whistle
An extra instrument file for adding more tin whistle types to Musescore, it needs to be
installed as an instrument extension using the MuseScore menu. Use the same file for
both MuseScore-2 and MuseScore-3:

MuseScore-2
1. copy file this tin-whistle.xml file to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: File -> Preferences... -> Scores tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to Documents/MuseScore2/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml and add to 'Instrument List 2'

MuseScore-3
1. copy file this tin-whistle.xml file to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml
2. within Musescore menu navigate to: MuseScore -> Preferences... -> Score tab
3. in the Default Files panel, add the file to 'Instrument List 2' extension
4. browse to Documents/MuseScore3/Extensions/tin-whistle.xml and add to 'Instrument List 2'

MuseScore wil now list more tin whistles types under 'World Music' 'Woodwinds'. Once the
tin whistle staff is added to the score, then there is no need to keep this instrument
file in the 'Instrument List 2' extension.

The Tin Whistle, which is a metal 6 hole Flageolet, comes in various tunings. These are
listed in order of decreasing physical size:
* "B♭ Tin Whistle" tuned to key B♭, also used for keys Cm and E♭
* "C Tin Whistle" tuned to C, also for Dm and F
* "D Tin Whistle" tuned to D, also for Em and G
* "E♭ Tin Whistle" tuned to E♭, also for Fm and A♭
* "F Tin Whistle" tuned to F, mainly used for Gm as F can be played on a C whistle
* "G Tin Whistle" tuned to G, mainly used for Am as G can be played on a D whistle

Tuning to D is by far the most common, so "Tin Whistle" is the same as "D Tin Whistle".
